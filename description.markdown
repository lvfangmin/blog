### About Allango

[Allango][] is a personal blog, the purpose of this blog is to memo and share the knowledges learned from working, and wonderful life.

Sharing knowledge can seem like a burden to some but on the contrary, it is a reflection of teamwork and leadership. Often, we are too slow to recognize how much and in what ways we can assist each other through sharing such expertise and knowledge. So let's feel free to share, it's a continual spiritual exercise.
